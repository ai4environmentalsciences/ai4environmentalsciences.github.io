 I work at the intersection of water sciences and machine learning. I am interested in application of data-driven approaches to solve problems related to water resources with special focus on surface water quality, catchment dynamics and water treatment. I did my Bachelor from Punjab University, Pakistan in Applied Geology. After that I moved to Germany and did MS in Hydrogeology and Environmental Geosciences from Goettingen university. Then I cam to Korea and completed my PhD from Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology in Environmental Engineering.
