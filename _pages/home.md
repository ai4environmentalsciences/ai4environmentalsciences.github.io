### About the Lab

We work at the intersection of environmental sciences and data-science. Our focus is on utilization of cutting edge machine learning methods for solving environmental problems. We espcially focus on water quality, water treatment, hydrological modeling. We build both process based and data-driven solutions for improvement in water quality focusing on E. coli, antibiotics, antibiotic resistance genes, pesticides, micropollutants, harmful algal blooms etc.
